HOW TO RUN
----------

First, run "server.py", then run "client.py". The client will ask you to enter an IP address to connect to the server.


HOW TO PLAY
-----------

The UI is very straightforward. After entering an IP, choose a difficulty by pressing the corresponding button.
This will open the game window where you can press one of the 9 button slots to perform a move when it is your turn.
Once the game ends, you will see a button at the bottom which will allow you to play again if you wish to.
